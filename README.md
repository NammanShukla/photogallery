# photogallery

## A responsive photo gallery webpage (Only using HTML, CSS and JS)

### Task 1

Given the params, I have to make a header which is fairly simple and a Modal which I might tussle with a bit more than i'm thinking right now. but very first step should be making the site responsive. 

For the images, I can either collect images online and toss them in an /asset folder or just use an API call to fetch me some from a easily accessible database. 
The latter might be above the current task but cool nonetheless.

Note : After recalling the transcript of the call with Ms.Jyoti, I was able to remember the usage of picsum which doesnt complicate things at all rather helps me by giving me a third option (thank you Ms.Jyoti!), and I also recall the image limit to be 12 images from the same call which gives me more params. 


### Task 2 


After the basic HTML, CSS and JS run with the photo gallery; Have to convert the list of images into a carousel, while I have to do this without using NPM (Nooo;-;) it is doable using just JS. The resolution of this carousel is set to 200x200, all while still maintaing the ability of using modals to scale the image to normalancy. I would be using arrow keys on either side to traverse the carousel.

Now for the actual heavy bit, I have to make a .gitignore, make an .ENV type of file, Load it in(don't think that is how JS works) and then call in the API for Pixabay which is like a image hosting site like Imgur. Using Pixabay API, Ill get the images replacing the old Task 1 method of using picsum. To call that API, I would be using AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) typically implemented when there is a need to update the page without reloading. The image limit this time is 10 min and 20 max.
