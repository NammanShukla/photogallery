# photogallery

A responsive photo gallery webpage (Only using HTML, CSS and JS)

Given the params, I have to make a header which is fairly simple and a Modal which I might tussle with a bit more than i'm thinking right now. but very first step should be making the site responsive. 

For the images, I can either collect images online and toss them in an /asset folder or just use an API call to fetch me some from a easily accessible database. 
The latter might be above the current task but cool nonetheless.

Note : After recalling the transcript of the call with Ms.Jyoti, I was able to remember the usage of picsum which doesnt complicate things at all rather helps me by giving me a third option (thank you Ms.Jyoti!), and I also recall the image limit to be 12 images from the same call which gives me more params.
